    <h3>Beginnings</h3>
        <p>In the mid 1980s Four Winds Enterprises, a large privately owned transportation company based in San Diego, California, was experiencing the pains of successful expansion of their core business. A growing fleet of equipment, scattered all around the world needed systematic management of maintenance records to meet safety, regulation and budget mandates. As part of an exploding business plan, Four Winds - known for their technical savvy, innovation and willingness to purchase the best tools to run their business became one of the first companies in San Diego to purchase the newest generation of IBM 'Super Mini' - the System 38. This System had an advanced architecture and relational database that revolutionized data handling but Four Winds quickly found there were no adequate applications available to meet their equipment maintenance management needs on the new System. To this end, Four Winds found the best available Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS) available on the previous IBM generation of mini-computer and struck a deal to develop a new and more powerful version for their use on the new System 38. The resulting 'MainTracker' system was the first of its kind to provide advanced relational database technology based CMMS in a platform as powerful and affordable as the System 38. Four Winds Enterprises created another company called Four Winds Systems, whose primary function was to develop sales and support to distribute the new system to a fast growing industry that embraced the System 38 and the subsequent IBM AS/400.</p>

    <h3>Transitions</h3>
    <p>In 1989, Four Winds Systems was sold to the current ownership and the corporation's name was changed to Four Winds Group, Inc (FWG). At the time, with the smaller PC and PC server technology becoming the niche computers of choice, FWG searched around the country to find a partner who offered PC based maintenance management software. FWG found a company on the east coast of the USA and was now able to provide a DOS based maintenance management solution. This company's products went from DOS to the first generation Windows and finally to the Windows 95 based application environment, the product being called, 'MPET'. In 2005 FWG was able to purchase the software business in order to offer more flexibility to our growing list of clients. When the software purchase was completed, an intense effort commenced to create a new product under the .NET development environment. After two years, M-PET.NET 1.0.0.0 was delivered. This platform, supported by our very knowledgeable team of software developers is continually being improved and enhanced to ensure it is delivering the promised maintenance management information in the best way possible. With a desktop and web application available, M-PET.NET offers capabilities and functions not duplicated nor available from other companies in this very competitive marketplace. Continual development based on customer feedback, needs, and technological advancements, will ensure that M-PET.NET will continue to grow. The focus on customer satisfaction has proven time and again that when customers are asked about Four Winds Group's M-PET.NET system, their response is always FWG provides rapid response to problems and their desire to keep their system both relevant and current gives us a confidence in both their capability and longevity.</p>
